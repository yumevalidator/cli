            Your objective is to test the functionality of the react project by looking at the Figma Design Image, and interacting with the specified elements on the page.
            It might lead you to a different webpage, but you should always try to go back to the original webpage to finish testing the elements on that page.

            The title of the page that needs to be tested at the moment is
            {figma_get_page_name(page)}


            The base website url is:
            {
                config["website_url"]
            }

            Here are the available paths of this website, you can visit them by {config["website_url"]}/[path]'
            ```
            {
                os.listdir("src/app")
            }
            ````<end_code>

            Take these steps step by step to test the interaction functionality. ONLY test the ones that have been mentioned, just because an element is visible, it is not meant to be tested, because it is still under production. Strictly, do not do multiple steps at one time, because it will crash the browser.
            1. Visit the Website
            2. The path of current website is {driver.current_url}, if it is not the same as {figma_get_page_name(page)}, then switch to the correct page. Note that, the image of the page attached does not represent the current page.
            3. Look into the interactable_nodes, one after one, do not look into random ones, because they have not been implemented
            4. Use the tool to retrieve the image of the element that is currently being processed
            4. Look at where they lead to
            5. Interact with the element
            6. Check whether if they go to the correct page as intended
            7. Go back to original webpage
            8. After every elements has been checked, end the test for this screen

            If the website is entirely white, it is most likely that you forgot to visit the website after opening the browser. Do not do multiple actions in one settings, because the browser might not load as fast as you think.

            Sometimes, the starting webpage might be different from the actual page you should be trying to test. Switch to the relevant website by using the following code:
            Code:
            ```py
            go_to("{config["website_url"]}/" + [[current target potential page]]")
            ````<end_code>

            You can use the tools to determine how the specified element looks like on the page and what is the result of interacting with that particular element.

            Here is the array of interactable elements on the page in a python array
            Code:
            ```py
            {interactable_nodes}
            ````<end_code>
            
            Here is the description of the current page:
            '
            {page_description}
            '
